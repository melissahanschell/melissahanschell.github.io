					<h1 class="posttitle">How Working Remotely Has Changed My Life (And why you need to do it too)</h1>
					<p class="lead">Pajamas all day, everyday	
					<p>After graduating with a journalism degree in 2013 I decided that a life full of broken schedules and late nights just wasn’t for me. I mean, if I want to wake up at 3am every few nights to cover a breaking story, I’d rather be doing it for a baby — at least the baby will love me back.
					<p>Fast forward two more years and I have an Education degree with no prospects. I’m pretty sure I spent the summer of 2014 going on countless job boards and interviews with nothing to show for it.
					<p>I’ll be honest, I did find a few jobs I could try out, but with them came travelling for over 2 hours a day, long days and sucky pay. It’s not really what I had in mind when I pictured a “dream job.”
					<p>It wasn’t until I decided to stop searching for that perfect job and create it for myself. So, I started to freelance and eventually made a career out of it.
					<p>And what has it afforded me to do? Here are a few of the many things working remotely has allowed me to do:
					<ul>
						<li>Be a full-time mother to my four month old</li>
						<li>Play with her throughout the day because I can</li>
						<li>Stay in my pajamas all day</li>
						<li>Work from my favourite coffee shop</li>
						<li>Be home when my husband gets home</li>
						<li>Have breakfast and lunch with my daughter</li>
						<li>Buy a cabin in the woods and make that my permanent residence</li>
						<li>Make my own hours and work during the time of day when I feel the most productive</li>
						<li>Work out of a villa in Tuscany for the week if I wanted to </li>
					</ul>
					<p>Even though some may argue that working remotely might mean I’m not as productive, or that I build no social connections with others at work, or that I may face an onslaught of interruptions because I have a child, I wouldn’t have it any other way.
					<p>I mean, you’re probably reading this and thinking, “You mean I don’t have to shower or brush my hair all day?” Nope, go crazy. Though I probably would recommend against not showering.
					<p>The knowledge that life is short has always been a passing thought, yet always fleeting. It wasn’t until I had my daughter when I realized just how short life really is. If you have children you know what I mean.
					<p>And with that realizaton also came the thought that my daughter also won’t be young forever. She will get bigger and eventually won’t need me anymore, so the time I have with her now is precious…and short lived.
					<p>So, I welcome the interruptions and breaks and chaos that come with working remotely because it means I’m spending time with my child. If I’m lucky, I’ll only get to experience a handful of more times before she starts walking and no longer wants to be held, before she starts talking to her friends and not with me as much, before she stops holding my hand and becomes independent.
					<p>Working from home gives me the privilege of being with her at all times while making money simultaneously. It’s a double whammy! Because at the end of the day, when the years have passed and you no longer have an abundance of time to use it’s the experiences and moments you shared with your family you remember the most, not the late nights at the office.
					<p>You don’t have to work 40 hours a week in order to be productive. Making your own hours means that you can work for half that time and still get all your tasks done — with time to spare to make that soccer game.
					<p>Just remember that those late nights don’t matter. Those late nights won’t help you gain five extra years of life — instead they actually might take years off — and those late nights won’t make your kids love you more. It’s your presence and time they wan’t the most — two things that are free.
					<p>So, if you’re able to work from home, good for you. You’ve just gained a few more hours of time with your family that you would have otherwise lost cumulatively working away from them. Now, go make a snack. You deserve it.
