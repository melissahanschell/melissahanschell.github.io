					<h1 class="posttitle">New Year, New You?</h1>
					<p class="lead">2016, the year of infinite possibilities.
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.”</p>
						<footer><cite title="Rumi">Rumi</cite></footer>
					</blockquote>
					<p>So 2015 has come and gone. You’ve probably encountered some ups and downs, some experiences worth remembering and some thoughts/goals you’d like to carry over in the new year.
					<p>Change is constantly sought after with every passing year — either a change of environment, a change of mindset, or my ultimate favourite, change of physical appearance (gym time!). If one thing’s certain, we are constantly craving to achieve a better version of ourselves, one that we will be happier with this year, in this new time.
					<p>We seek, but fail to rise on a consistent basis. Why? You can blame it on laziness or our inability to have clear visions. The fact of the matter is, there’s no time for excuses. The time you have spent contemplating whether or not you should do something could have been spent planning that very thing. You don’t get that time back people.
					<p>As Steve Jobs eloquently pointed out:
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.
						<p>Almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.
						<p>Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>As we’ve all heard before, knowledge is power — but so is time. Once you accept that your time is limited, the faster you will realize that you really don’t know anything. So, why not use the time you have to learn, listen and love a bit more than you did yesterday.
					<p>Be better than what you are today.
					<p><strong>You are</strong> what you want to be. <strong>You are</strong> who you spend your time with. <strong>You are</strong> the perspective you live by. <strong>You are</strong> the changes you decide to make.
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The beautiful journey of today can only begin when we learn to let go of yesterday.”</p>
						<footer><cite title="Steve Maraboli">Steve Maraboli</cite></footer>
					</blockquote>
					<p>It took me a long time to realize that life is built on a series of choices you make every day. If you want to be fit, you will take the steps to get there. If you want to start a business, heck — the only thing stopping you is you, and this underlying fear that you’ll somehow drown in the process. But you’re already naked remember?
					<p>It’s all about perspective. Prioritize your life so that you can execute your goals. It’s more than just being positive. It’s about having the perspective that you can make a difference in your own life. You have the power, whether you choose to believe it or not — told you it’s all about choices!
					<p>So, the next time you find yourself trying to build new year’s resolutions, you might want to start thinking about how you can build life goals instead. What can you do now that will make you a better person, friend, athlete, cook, entrepreneur, musician, parent…and the list goes on. Go all in and plan big. Do the impossible. You’ll amaze yourself at just how much you can accomplish by making the choice to do so.
					<p><strong>You can</strong> change. <strong>You can</strong> preservere. And <strong>you can</strong> know more than you did yesterday.
					<p>Just get naked. Your possibilities are endless.
					<p>This is a new year. A new beginning. And things are bound to change, if you let them. So, the real question then becomes: how bad do you want it?
